                <p>Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images,
                    visualizations, and other pictures. However, more than anything else,
                    they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip teams to design
                    and code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces using systems, it's
                    essential that words depend on a strong foundation of typography.

                <p> I'll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design
                    degree. I'm never the person choosing a font, scaling type, or
                    finessing letter spacing. As a result, I've always been reluctant to
                    write about typography.

                    On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I've
                    contributed to many design systems that set a foundation for
                    typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a foundation
                    and apply it to an emerging library of interface components. This
                    article summarizes those patterns.

                    Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and weights
                    along with fallbacks. It then explores how to build hierarchy using
                    size, color, additional details like line-height, and layering
                    responsiveness. Those models are then applied to components in a
                    system's library (like Article and Header) as well as custom
                    components made by other teams.
